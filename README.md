# courseapp
An educational app for children designed to help them learn programming in a fun and easy way through games. The app begins with an initial assessment to determine each child's level and place them in the appropriate group. It also provides continuous parental follow-up through weekly reports and fosters a spirit of competition among students with daily and weekly challenges based on collecting points.
